# Dynamically Created Inputs (Currently under Construction üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

## Installation & Usage (WIP)

1. `npm i react-dynamic-input`

2. Add `DynamicInput` to your components like this:

## Example

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"
import DynamicInput from "react-dynamic-input"

const App = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState([{ name: "" }])

  const showState = () => {
    alert(input.map(item => item.name))
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <DynamicInput
        inputName="name"
        addButtonText="Add Another Input"
        setInput={setInput}
        input={input}
        onSubmit={showState}
        submitButtonText="Submit"
        addPosition="bottom"
      />
      {input.map(item => (
        <p>{item.name}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## To Do

- [x] Create a button that will add another input
- [x] Give each of the inputs its own value
- [x] Add a remove button that will take away the desired input
- [x] Pass a onSubmit function to component (mauybe just leave this to the user??)
- [x] Make a reusable component that can accept props
- [ ] Create GIF of working component
- [ ] Add basic styling for inputs (Styled Components??)
- [ ] Publish to NPM
- [ ] (Possible) Add a submit button for eact of the inputs individually to only submit one thing
