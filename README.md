# Create Multiple Inputs!

`react-dynamic-input` allows you to create multiple inputs that each have their own unique state that you define. It also comes with a built in `onSubmit` button which takes a function that you ceate. Add it to a form or whatever user input you need!

## Installation & Usage

1. `npm i react-dynamic-input`

2. Add `DynamicInput` to your components like this:

```js
import DynamicInput from "react-dynamic-input"

class YourComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <DynamicInput />
  }
}
```

**`props` for the `<DynamicInput/>`:**

## Example

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"
import DynamicInput from "react-dynamic-input"

const App = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState([{ name: "" }])

  const showState = () => {
    alert(input.map(item => item.name))
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <DynamicInput
        inputName="name"
        addButtonText="Add Another Input"
        setInput={setInput}
        input={input}
        onSubmit={showState}
        submitButtonText="Submit"
        addPosition="bottom"
      />
      {input.map((item, index) => (
        <p key={(index + 1) * 2}>{item.name}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Styling

_Each of the Elements in the `react-dynamic-input` Component can be targeted througn CSS with a `className` attribute (the entire component can be targeted with an id):_

- **Enitre Component:**

```css
#DynamicInput {
  /* Add whatever CSS you'd like! */
}
```

- **Add Button:**

```css
.addButton {
  /* Add whatever CSS you'd like! */
}
```

- **Remove Button:**

```css
.removeButton {
  /* Add whatever CSS you'd like! */
}
```

- **Submit Button:**

```css
.submitButton {
  /* Add whatever CSS you'd like! */
}
```

- **Input:**

```css
.dynamicInput {
  /* Add whatever CSS you'd like! */
}
```

## Wish List:

- Basic Styling for inputs ([Styled Components?](https://www.styled-components.com/))
- (Possible) Add a submit button for eact of the inputs individually to only submit one thing
